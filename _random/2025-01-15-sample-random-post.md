# Sample Random Post

This is a sample post in the `_random` collection. 

## How it works

- Posts in `_random/` directory will appear on `/random`
- Posts in `_posts/` directory will appear on `/notes` (if they have `show_on_notes: true`)
- Each collection is completely separate

## Features

- ✅ Separate collection from posts
- ✅ Own pagination
- ✅ Own URL structure
- ✅ Independent of the main blog

This allows you to have different types of content organized separately!
