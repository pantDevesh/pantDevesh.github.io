Today, I completed my first 50-kilometer bicycle ride!

As a kid, owning a cycle was a dream. But growing up in the hills, that simple dream took years to realize. Roads weren't right outside our doorstep, you often had to carry the cycle all the way from the main road to your home (if there was a road at all) and even fixing a small puncture could mean a 50 km trip. A few of my friends who lived closer to the main road owned cycles, but I rarely got to ride one myself. Add to that my introverted nature and a *few false* promises (which probably helped me top my class), and cycling never really became a part of my childhood.

Even during undergrad, my college was again in a hilly area and no chance for cycling there either. I actually learned to ride for the first time at IIT Delhi in February 2018, when we were there for the Tryst tech fest. We lost the Robosoccer event one-sided (we lost against a team called AndhiMaut from IIITD and our score was in minus ðŸ¥¹), but during those three days I rented a cycle and rode across the campus. I still remember learning near the SIT building, falling several times on that downhill slope before finally balancing myself. That feeling of finally learning it was unforgettable and boy, was I proud of myself.

Six years later, I bought my first cycle: a Cradiac xc900 mountain bike, and 50km ride after almost a year.

I started my ride at 5:30 AM. I should mention that I've always considered myself below average at outdoor sports like running and cycling (maybe it's genetics), so my pace might not impress anyone, but over the years I've learnt that my only competition is with myself. The first 10 km felt surprisingly easy. I rode straight to the Gaula River in Haldwani, where the morning breeze at the Gaula Bridge was incredibly refreshing. Then came the real challenge - the uphill stretch from Indira Gandhi International Stadium to Kathgodam Gaula Bridge. I had to stop multiple times for water and snacks, had multiple cramps, and even walked during steep climbs. By the time I reached Kathgodam Railway Station, I'd covered around 20 km.

After that, the fun part began: the long downhill ride till Lamachaur Bridge, just before the Fatehgarh-Kaladhungi forest. Around the 38 km mark, I was completely exhausted and out of water, so I grabbed a bottle of Sting instead and pushed through the final 12 km, tracing my route back to complete the full 50.

It was tough but deeply satisfying. There's something about finishing a physically demanding task that leaves you both drained and proud. Hopefully, this is just the beginning and soon I might explore new terrains, and one day, maybe even ride across Europe? ðŸ˜‡
