Iâ€™m currently working as an Associate Machine Learning Scientist at Wadhwani AI, where I develop AI solutions for healthcare and agriculture sectors. My work primarily involves training and deploying NLP and computer vision models. <br>
Earlier, I completed my MS (by Research) in Computer Science at IIT Delhi, with a thesis focused on robust text recognition in challenging scenarios, under the guidance of [Prof. Chetan Arora](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~chetan/) and [Prof. Aaditeshwar Seth](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~aseth/). <br> 
My broad interest lies in foundational vision models and multi-modal architectures. I'm passionate about creating scalable, accessible AI tools that can serve diverse and widespread communities.
