Iâ€™m currently working as an Associate Machine Learning Scientist at Wadhwani AI, where I work on bulding AI solutions for sectors like health and agriculture. My focus is on training and deploying NLP and computer vision models for real-world social impact in India. <br>
Earlier, I completed my MS (by Research) in Computer Science at IIT Delhi, with a thesis focused on robust text recognition in challenging scenarios, under the guidance of [Prof. Chetan Arora](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~chetan/) and [Prof. Aaditeshwar Seth](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~aseth/) I still find myself reading OCR papers on weekends â€” guess my Masterâ€™s work did a number on me ðŸ˜ƒ. <br> 
I'm broadly interested in large language models, foundational vision models, and multi-modal architectures. I'm passionate about creating scalable, accessible AI tools that can serve diverse and widespread communities.
